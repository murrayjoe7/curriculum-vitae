<h4>
    Why Am I Interesting?
</h4>

</div>

<p1>
    I am an enthusiastic and ambitious graduate with a keen interest in training to become a software developer. 
    <br>
    I first became interested in this topic whilst studying Computing GCSE, where I wrote very basic code to design games, which led me to develop an understanding of the subject. 
    <br>
    I love problem-solving, I enjoy working with numbers and mathematics was always my strongest subject at A-Level. 
    <br>
    I have great attention to detail and I am always very accurate with all my work.
    <br>
    My strengths include strong communication skills and an ability to work collaboratively with different teams.
    <br>
    I am solutions focussed and really thrive when being able to apply creative and innovative thinking.
