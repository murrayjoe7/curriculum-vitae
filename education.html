<h4>
    University of Westminster Business School - 2015-2019
</h4>

</div>

<p>
    Second Class Honours Degree in Finance with Management
    <br>
    The course included the background of financial systems, as well as the practicalities and figuring behind them; this incorporated the use of statistical calculations and formulae which I particularly excelled at.
    <br>
    The final year coursework was an in-depth exploration of the financial markets using new IT equipment; this was mostly self-taught and required advanced understanding of both new and old operating systems.
